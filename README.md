Portfolio Project - www.kubilaixd.site

This project is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my experiences and projects in the world of software and technology. It includes the following sections:

About Me: A section that provides information about my background in software development, areas of interest, and professional goals.

Projects: A list of projects I have developed using various technologies and programming languages. Each project includes links to the corresponding GitHub repositories and brief descriptions.

Social Links: Quick access to my profiles on platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram via social media icons.

Technologies Used:

HTML & CSS: Used to create the structure and design of the site, with a modern and minimalist approach.

Bootstrap: Utilized to support the responsive design of the page and enhance the user experience.


The projects showcased in this portfolio were developed to demonstrate my skills in software development and the technologies I've learned. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or explore new technologies. My projects focus on code quality, user experience, and performance.

Note: Due to limitations with requests to the GitHub API, the projects have been manually added to the site.
